I"#<p>High-throughput technologies have generated a deluge of data describing living
organisms at unprecedented resolution. The wealth and diversity of biological
data available provide unique opportunities to understand the design principles
underpinning cellular life. The democratisation of DNA synthesis allow us to use
these design rules to engineer new designer systems ranging from genes to
chromosomes.</p>

<p>Our long term goal is to reverse-engineer biological systems to create
generative algorithms to design, build and test biochemical agents for addressing
healthcare and industrial biotechnology problems.</p>

        Enzymes are building blocks of cellular life and act as natural catalysts able 
        to accelerate almost any reaction. Enzymatic deficiencies are usually associated 
        with devastating rare diseases, which can only be treated by providing 
        the defective enzyme through intravenous injections. However, enzymes loose 
        catalytic activity in blood and often cause a severe immune response; moreover,
        current manufacturing technologies have low yield, which dramatically raises the cost of 
        treatment.<br />

        Here we are building on our expertise in machine learning and synthetic genomics 
        to design and build human enzymes at scale. Our goal is to establish technologies 
        to optimise the therapeutic properties of synthetic enzymes and to engineer 
        expression systems for inexpensive production of these molecules, in order to 
        provide new sustainable treatment for patients with rare metabolic disorders.
