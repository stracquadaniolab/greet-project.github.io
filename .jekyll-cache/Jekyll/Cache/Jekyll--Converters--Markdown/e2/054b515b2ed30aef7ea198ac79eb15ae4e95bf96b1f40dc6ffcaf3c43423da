I"Ì<p>We are a multi-disciplinary research group based at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/biology">School of Biological
Sciences</a> at the <a href="https://www.ed.ac.uk/">University of
Edinburgh</a> interested in understanding the molecular
mechanisms underpinning complex phenotypes and diseases using two of the most
disruptive technologies available: synthetic biology and machine learning. Our
long term goal is to reverse-engineer biological systems to create generative
algorithms to design, build and test biological agents for addressing healthcare
and industrial biotechnology problems. Our group is extremely interdisciplinary
and includes members with engineering, biology and informatics background.</p>
