    <b>Short bio.</b> Giovanni Stracquadanio is an UKRI EPSRC fellow, Senior Lecturer in Synthetic Biology and
    co-director of the Edinburgh Genome Foundry (EGF).<br />

    Dr Stracquadanio obtained a PhD in Informatics from the University of Catania
    (Italy) in 2010, and then received postdoctoral training in synthetic biology in
    Joel Bader and Jef Boeke labs at the Johns Hopkins University working on the
    synthetic yeast genome. Dr Stracquadanio was a main contributor to the Synthetic
    Yeast (Sc2.0) genome project, pioneering algorithms and developing software at
    the foundation of the first synthetic eukaryotic genome. He has also developed
    tools used in large-scale synthesis projects, streamlining chromosomes
    engineering and the assembly of biological pathways.

    <br />
    In 2014, he moved to the Ludwig Institute for Cancer Research (LICR) at the University
    of Oxford to work on cancer genetics, in Gareth Bondâ€™s lab; here, he focused on
    studying how high-frequency inherited p53 mutations affect the risk of cancer
    and response to treatment using statistical genetics methods.

    <br />
    In 2016, before moving to the University of Edinburgh, Dr Stracquadanio
    established the first computational biology lab at the School of Computer
    Science and Electronic Engineering of the University of Essex, and in 2017
    received the Wellcome Trust Seed Award in Science.
    <br />
    Dr Stracquadanio has authored more than 40 research articles published in international 
    peer-reviewed journals, including Science, Nature Rev. Cancer, Cancer Research and PNAS.
    He also serves as Associate Editor for BMC Genomics and has reviewer for EPSRC, BBSRC, MRC and FLF. 
    Since 2021, he is also a member of the EPSRC Peer Review Associate College.

                <i>PhD student, Biomedical AI CDT, University of Edinburgh</i><br />
                Short bio: I am a PhD student of the Biomedical AI CDT funded by UKRI. My research work focuses on developing variational methods to design human enzymes for treating rare enzymatic disorders. Prior to this, I obtained a BSc in Economics/Mathematics, St.Petersburg State University of Engineering and Economics followed by a MSc in Finance from University of Maryland. I worked for almost 4 years in World Bank in Washington,DC as a quantitative analyst before I decided to change my career path to Data Science. I obtained MSc Statistics and Data Science from the University of Edinburgh and then immediately got into Biomedical AI CDT. Outside of work I like playing tennis, reading, going to a theatre or travelling.

                <i>PhD student, EastBIO CDT, University of Edinburgh</i><br />
                Short bio: I am a PhD student on the EASTBIO DTP, funded jointly by BBSRC and Fujifilm Diosynth Biotechnologies. I research codon optimisation for heterologous protein expression using machine learning and NLP techniques. Broadly speaking, I am trying to teach computers to understand the language of biological sequences. Prior to this, I completed my BSc in Molecular Biology at UCL, worked as a policy officer on climate change at BEIS, and then completed my Bioinformatics MSc at QMUL. When I am not doing science, I love to star-gaze, hike, write songs and illustrate. My science communication heroes are Jacob Bronowski, Carl Sagan and Kurzgesagt.
